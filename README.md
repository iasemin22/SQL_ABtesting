# SQL_ABtesting
This Coursera 4 week course covers how to convert timestamps of all types to common formats and perform date/time calculations. We have selected and performed the optimal JOIN for a data science inquiry and clean data within an analysis dataset by deduping, running quality checks, backfilling, and handling nulls. Covered how to segment and analyze data per segment using windowing functions and use case statements to execute conditional logic to address a data science inquiry. The course has described how to convert a query into a scheduled job and how to insert data into a date partition. Finally, given a predictive analysis need, we have engineered a feature from raw data using the tools and skills built over the course. The real-world application of these skills have given me the framework for performing the analysis of an AB test.
